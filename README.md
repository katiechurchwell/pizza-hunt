Pizza Hunt—a self-aware riff on social-media applications that already exist for other topics—lets users connect with each other based on their love of pizza. In Pizza Hunt, users can share and discuss their dream pizza-topping combinations. Pizza is ubiquitous in everyday life all over the world, and no application has ever been created with the sole purpose of facilitating discussions about it.
